# Two Streams

## The what

Two Streams is a small front end to the amazing [peerflix](https://github.com/mafintosh/peerflix) command-line tool.

## The why

Two Streams makes it easier to select which file you want peerflix to stream and, as a native OS X app, it registers magnet links so you can open Two Streams straight from the browser.

## The install

Still under development so package not provided, just clone and build. I also don't have a developer account so I cannot officially sign the app.
